  <p> 1. Leave butter on the counter until your finger leaves an imprint. 
    Once softened (not melted), beat the butter and sugars into a light, fluffy mixture.</p>

  <p> 2. Then, beat in the egg and vanilla until completely blended.</p>

  <p> 3. Stir in flour, baking soda, and salt until they just disappear into the dough.</p>

  <p> 4. Add the chocolate chips (and optional nuts) last to prevent over mixing, which can lead to tough cookies.</p>

  <p> 5. Bake one cookie sheet at a time. Check cookies after 8 minutes to see if they are golden brown around the edges.</p>

  <p> 6. Cool cookies on the cookie sheet for two minutes, then move them to a cooling rack. 
    This allows them to set up a bit before removing, resulting in perfect chewy centers and crispy edges.</p>
